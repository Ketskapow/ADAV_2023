This graph shows the amount of sleep that different types of mammals get depending on their diet and brain to body ratio. There are a couple things you can see in this graph:
- Herbivores generally have smaller brain to body ratios than other mammals. They also generally sleep less than other animals
- Omnivores generally have larger brain/body ratio's than herbivores and tend to sleep for a larger part of the day
- The few insectivores in the dataset have a very large brain/body ratio
- There is no relationship between brain/body ratio and total sleep that is visible from this graph.
